            <p> Explore incredibly sounds on this beautiful landscapes with friends or family. Enjoy the charms of the wild coastline listed as a "natural site" with its steep cliffs overlooked by the formidable Natureland. The coastal path, is a breath taking expirience, as well as the interior network, make the island a wonderful location for walkers. Use the sign-posted routes as your guide and take your time with a leisurely ramble. Streams become wider and shallower just above waterfalls due to flowing over the rock shelf, and there is usually a deep area just below the waterfall because of the kinetic energy of the water hitting the bottom. Waterfalls normally form in a rocky area due to erosion. After a long period of being fully formed, the water falling off the ledge will retreat, causing a horizontal pit parallel to the waterfall wall. </p> </div>

           <p class="p">As the watercourse increases its velocity at the edge of the waterfall, it plucks material from the riverbed. Whirlpools created in the turbulence as well as sand and stones carried by the watercourse increase the erosion capacity. This causes the waterfall to carve deeper into the bed and to recede upstream. Often over time, the waterfall will recede back to form a canyon or gorge downstream as it recedes upstream. Waterfalls normally form in a rocky area due to erosion. After a long period of being fully formed, the water falling off the ledge will retreat, causing a horizontal pit parallel to the waterfall wall. Eventually, as the pit grows deeper, the waterfall collapses to be replaced by a steeply sloping stretch of river bed. Earth movement caused by earthquakes or landslides. </p>
